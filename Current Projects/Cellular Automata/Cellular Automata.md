Cellular Automata (CAs) update the state of some lattice $L$ - usually assuming 2D but not strictly limited to this. The system is updated with $L \rightarrow L^{new}$ where $L^{new}_{i,j} = f( \mathcal{N}(L_{i,j}))$ - which means that an individual state on the lattice is updated by some function of it's neighbourhood $\mathcal{N}(L_{i,j})$.

Conway's Game of Life is a famous example.
