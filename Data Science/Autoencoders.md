A type of [[Neural Networks|neural network]], where a hidden layer has lower dimensionality than the input and output layer. Hence the encoder part of the network (input to hidden layer) performs non-linear PCA on the inputs, producing a lower dimensional embedding of the input with minimal information loss.
